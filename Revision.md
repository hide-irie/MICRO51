title: Guidelines for Revisions to MICRO 2017
---

1. **Revision is optional**. While revising the paper is a strong way to address reviewer concerns, submitting a revision is not a requirement for the paper to get accepted. You can submit a revision, a rebuttal, or nothing at all.

2. **Submitting a revision does not guarantee acceptance**.  While revising the paper may increase the likelihood of acceptance, it does not guarantee that the paper will get accepted, as the revision still has to be effective in addressing the concerns of the reviewers. We expect over half of the papers invited for revision to get accepted. Please plan accordingly.

3. The main purpose of the revision is to **address the questions posed by reviewers** and possibly to enhance the editorial quality of the paper. You should focus on the changes that are explicitly asked by the reviewers. It is fine to add new results if solicited. Please avoid adding unsolicited ideas, results, or material. However, you are encouraged to edit your paper to enhance readability and clarity.

4. Revised versions are allowed an **extra half-page** (i.e., up to a single column) to address reviewer comments. Your total budget is **11.5 pages of text** plus unlimited references. If your additions require more than half a page, you will need to create space for it by trimming or removing other content from your submission. **All other formatting guidelines remain unchanged**. A revision that violates formatting guidelines will be returned with no option for a resubmission.

5. All content **additions and modifications should be highlighted** in the revised version. We have prepared a modified LaTeX template (available [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/downloads/micro50-latex-revision-template.tar.gz)) that automates this process. You can also do this manually with a PDF editor such as Acrobat. Please make sure the resulting PDF looks similar to the following [sample revision paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/downloads/samplerevisionpaper.pdf). For figures and tables, simply highlighting the caption is sufficient. Highlighting will help reduce the reviewer workload by letting reviewers focus on the content that has changed since the original submission.

6. Please **use the rebuttal as a "change log"**, pointing to newly added content or modified sections in response to reviewer questions. You may also add independent responses in the rebuttal to clarify any major misunderstandings or to point to parts of the original paper where the concern was already addressed.

7. Please **modify the header** of the revised version to "MICRO 2017 Submission #XXX (REVISION) – Confidential Draft – Do NOT Distribute!!", so that reviewers can easily identify which version is the original and which is the revision (replace XXX by your submission number). The revision template already incorporates this change.

8. **Preserve anonymity** in the revision. Ensure that the author names are not accidentally revealed (e.g., in the PDF metadata added by your PDF highlighting tool).

9. Revisions must be uploaded to the MICRO submission website by **June 14th 2017 at 11:59:59pm EST**. You can submit a revision by clicking "Edit" on your paper page, uploading the revised PDF, and clicking "Save revision". You can update the PDF as many times as you need. The system will retain both the original submission and the latest revision.

We thank Moin Qureshi for providing the MICRO 2015 revision instructions, upon which these guidelines are based.
