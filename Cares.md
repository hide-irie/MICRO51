<p>The conference organizers wish to bring to the attention of all ISCA’18 attendees the ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment 
found <a href="https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment" target="_blank">here</a>,
and the corresponding IEEE Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment found <a href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/whatis/nondiscrimination.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. 
We ask all attendees to abide by these policies.</p>

<p>
We also are proud to be the second conference to host the CARES joint subcommittee of SIGARCH and SIGMICRO. The role of CARES is to serve as a resource comprising of well-known and respected people in the architecture community who are approachable and willing to listen to and help people who experience discrimination or harassment at our events. The CARES representatives at ISCA’18 will be: Margaret Martonosi (CARES co-chair), Lieven Eeckhout, and Joel Emer.
