A visa is required to enter the United States for many nationalities. Please check with your local U.S. embassy/consulate whether this applies to you. In case a visa is required, please apply as soon as possible, as obtaining the visa may take several weeks.

The United States Department of State provides a [list of countries](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/visit/visa-waiver-program.html) that are participants in the Visa Waiver Program.
