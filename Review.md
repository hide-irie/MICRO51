title: Review Model
---

MICRO 2017 will employ a revision-based review process similar to [MICRO 2015's](https://www.microarch.org/micro48/files/reviewmodel.html).
The authors of highly-ranked papers will be invited to submit a revised version to address reviewer concerns. All other papers will be invited to submit a rebuttal as usual. To give authors enough time to produce a meaningful revision, the author response period will last 14 days. Submitting a revision will be optional. Authors will be asked to highlight the content that has been modified in the revised version. We will provide a LaTeX template that automates the highlighting process.

The key dates for MICRO 2017 are as follows: 

 * Submission deadline for full paper: April 4th (11:59 pm EDT)
 * Reviews released to authors: June 1st
 * Deadline for rebuttal and revision: June 14th
 * Reviewers read revision/rebuttal: June 16th-21st
 * Final decision communicated to authors: July 5th
