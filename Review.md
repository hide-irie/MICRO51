title: Review Model
---

MICRO 2018 will employ a revision-based review process similar to [MICRO 2015's](https://www.microarch.org/micro48/files/reviewmodel.html).
The authors of highly-ranked papers will be invited to submit a revised version to address reviewer concerns. All other papers will be invited to submit a rebuttal as usual. To give authors enough time to produce a meaningful revision, the author response period will last 14 days. Submitting a revision will be optional. Authors will be asked to highlight the content that has been modified in the revised version. We will provide a LaTeX template that automates the highlighting process.

The key dates for MICRO 2018 are as follows: 
 * Submisson deadline for abstract: March 30th, 2018, 11:59 pm EDT
 * Submission deadline for full paper: April 6th, 2018, 11:59 pm EDT
 * Author Rebuttal/Revision: June 27th ? July 3rd, 2018 (11:59 pm EDT)
 * Final decision communicated to authors: July 18th
