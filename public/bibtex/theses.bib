	abstract = {The data access patterns of modern workloads are
                  increasingly less uniform which makes it hard to
                  design a memory hierarchy with rigid design
                  principles that performs optimally for a wide range
                  of workloads. This dissertation proposes and
                  evaluates the benefits of a novel architecture,
                  called the Amoeba Cache, for the on chip memory
                  hierarchy which would allow it to dynamically adapt
                  to the requirements of the application. We propose a
                  design that can support a variable number of cache
                  blocks, each of a different granularity. Compared to
                  a fixed granularity cache, the Amoeba Cache improves
                  cache utilization to 90\% - 99\% for most
                  applications, saves miss rate by up to 73\% at the L1
                  level and up to 88\% at the LLC level, and reduces
                  miss bandwidth by up to 84\% at the L1 and 92\% at the
                  LLC. The Amoeba Cache also reduces on-chip memory
                  hierarchy energy by as much as 36\% and improves
                  performance by as much as 50\%.},
