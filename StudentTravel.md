title: Student Travel Award
---

We are planning to provide student travel grant support for students to defray a portion of their travel cost. The size and number of these grants will vary depending on funding availability, the number of student applicants, and their respective priority. Grant awards will be made before the early registration deadline; expenses will be reimbursed after the conference; grant recipients will be asked to submit original receipts to verify their expenditures.

While we encourage all in need of a travel grant to apply, the selection process will give higher priority to students with greater involvement in the conference (presenter, co-author). Grants made available by NSF will use selection criteria that consider broader impact. We strongly encourage applications from students that belong to under-represented groups. Also, certain funds may be available to ACM SIGMICRO student members and IEEE Computer Society members only.



To apply for a travel grant:
Applicants must fill out the Travel Grant Application Form
<mark> (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqldv700h4q4nR71ZVc1VYhGVAx5lDZuYLftfkT2wvrY0Kog/viewform?usp=sf_link) </mark> before the deadline, ***September 1, 2017***.


Student applicants also need to ask their direct thesis advisor to send an e-mail to the Student Travel Award Chair [micro50stg@gmail.com](mailto:micro50stg@gmail.com) with the subject line ***MICRO Student Travel Status Confirmation for <Your Last Name, Your First Name>***, stating that you are a full-time student pursuing an MS/Ph.D. or an undergraduate researcher in the areas covered by MICRO. The advisor is also welcome to comment on the potential broader impact of making an award to you, e.g., if you belong to an underrepresented group, or if the candidate is unable to attend without a substantial travel grant.
Additional notes for the process:


Please save all the original receipts. You need to mail them later.
The confirmation email from their advisors should be received by the application deadline of ***September 1, 2017***. Your application is considered incomplete without it.
Due to the large number of applications we expect to receive, we will NOT solicit letters from your advisors. It is YOUR responsibility to ensure that your advisor sends the email before the deadline. No exception will be made for any reason.



We will do our best to notify you about the status of your application before the early registration deadline.  Note that award decisions will be made based on funding availability. Note also that some awards may be made only after the conference.
Depending on the source of funding, some awardees will be required to email the travel grant chair a short essay describing their experience attending the conference or their favorite paper.
