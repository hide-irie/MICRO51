## Call for Abstracts MICRO 51 ACM Student Research Competition (SRC)

## Important Dates

**Abstract submission: July 22, 2018 (11:59 pm EDT).**

**Acceptance notification: Aug 15, 2018.**

The 51st International Symposium on Microarchitecture is the
premier forum for presenting, discussing, and debating innovative
microarchitecture ideas and techniques for advanced computing and
communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers
in fields related to microarchitecture, compilers, chips, and
systems for technical exchange on traditional microarchitecture
topics and emerging research areas. The MICRO community has
enjoyed a close interaction between academic researchers and
industrial designers and we aim to continue this tradition at
MICRO-51. In 2018, MICRO will be held in Fukuoka, Japan.

## Overview

The 51st International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)
invites participation in the ACM Student Research
Competition (SRC). Sponsored by ACM and Microsoft Research, the
SRC is a forum for undergraduates and graduate students to share
their research results, exchange ideas, and improve their
communication skills while competing for prizes. Students
accepted to participate in the SRC are entitled to a travel
grant (up to $500) to help cover travel expenses. The top 3
undergraduate and graduate winners will receive the following
prizes:

1. Monetary prizes of $500, $300, and $200, respectively.

2. A framed Grand Finalist certificate.

3. The names of the winners and their placement will be posted on
the web site.

4. In addition, the first place winner in each
category (undergraduate, graduate) will receive an invitation to
participate in the SRC Grand Finals, an on-line round of
competitions among the first place winners of individual
conference-hosted SRCs. The top three graduate and undergraduate
Grand Finalists will receive an additional $500, $300, and $200,
respectively, along with Grand Finalist medals (gold, silver,
bronze). Grand Finalists and their advisors will be invited to
the Annual ACM Awards Banquet for an all-expenses-paid trip,
where they will be recognized for their accomplishments, along
with other prestigious ACM award winners, including the winner of
the Turing Award.

The SRC consists of two rounds: a poster session and a
presentation session. Submissions recommended for acceptance by
the selection committee will be invited to a first-round poster
session to be held during Micro-51.  A panel of judges will
select a number of finalists from the poster session held at the
symposium, who will be invited to a second-round SRC presentation
session at MICRO 2018 and compete for the prizes. The evaluation
will be concentrated on the quality of both visual and oral
presentation, the research methods, and the significance of
contribution. You can find more information on the ACM Student
Research Competition site (<a href="https://src.acm.org/">https://src.acm.org/</a>).

## Eligibility

A participant and submission in the SRC must meet all following
conditions:

* The participant must submit an up to 800-word
  abstract (optionally, blind) outlining the content of a poster
  that is going to be presented during the competition.
* The abstract must include the poster title, author names,
  affiliations, and the name of the academic advisor. The
  abstract may be authored by more than one student. However,
  only the lead student (first author) is considered as a
  participant in SRC competition and must satisfy the eligibility
  criteria described in this document.
* It should describe the research problem, motivation and
  background, techniques and results, and the prospect for
  clearly and concisely conveying the work in a poster format.
* It should state the novelty and contributions of the work
  explicitly.
* The submission deadline is July 22, 2018 at 23:59 EDT.
* The abstract must have not appeared before. Novelty is one of
  the criteria for selection.
* The abstract and the poster must be authored solely by the
  participant.
* The participant can be from anywhere in the world, but must be
  an ACM student member, and must maintain an undergraduate or
  graduate student status as of July 22, 2018.
* In your submission, please indicate whether you are an
  undergraduate or a graduate student.
* You may join ACM prior to entering. Basic student membership is
  $19 per year or less www.acm.org/membership.
* SRC allows parallel submissions of full papers in other
  conferences, as long as they abide by self-plagiarism
  rules (e.g., at least 30% of both the SRC abstract and the
  other publication is unique). That is, any paper needs to be a
  minimum of 30% different than a prior paper. So a full-length
  version of a paper would have to be at least 30% different than
  a SRC submission. Again, self-plagiarism rules would still be
  in effect.  For each accepted SRC poster, a one-page extended
  abstract will be posted on Micro-51 website. The content,
  however, can be included in a future submission to other
  conferences or journals.
